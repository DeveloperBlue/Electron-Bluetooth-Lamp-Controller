# Electron-Bluetooth-Lamp-Controller
Control a Bluetooth LED lamp over an Electron application

## General Theory

Using what I learned in CS488 (Wireshark, packet sniffing, various protocols and standards, etc.) and my personal skills with Electron and development, I plan to control an Bluetooth LED lamp. The lamp is a cheap offbrand item that only works using a dead obfuscated Android application.
My main setback has been finding a program similar to Wireshark for Blueooth that runs on my Android device. If that doesn't work, I can always try to set up an emulator on my dev machine.

## Goals
The goal is to build an Electron application (Windows, Mac, & Linux) that will allow me to control the lamp in basic ways- (On/Off, Set RGB Color, Get RGB Color, etc.) with a nice UI.

Stretch Goals:
- In the future have more advanced features (Music Mood Reaction, Color Shift, Rave Lights, Voice Control, Web Socket, etc.) and connect to other programs (Google Assistant, IFTTT, etc.).
- While the program is created to connect to my specific model lamp, a config for connecting/listening/changing any generic bluetooth lamp could be built.

This project was created as a Honors Option project for CS488 - Computer Networks & The Internet.

## To-Do
- Project documentation
